# TeensyNumPad Firmware
TeensyNumPad uses QMK firmware. You can flash the teensynumpad.hex file to the Teensy++ 2.0 micro-controller using Teensy Loader : https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html

The .hex file was generated using Keyboard Firmware Builder: https://kbfirmware.com/ 

If you want to modify this, you can upload the teensynumpad.json file and generate your own .hex file. You can also download a .zip file containing the QMK source code and build your own firmware locally using QMK MSYS.
